questions about it such as passing scores, average grades, what schools are performing better than others are there some

As per the chart some schools have very large budgets compared to others and student performance is still not up to par with some schools
who have smaller budgets.

Rodriguez High School had one of the larger budgets but it was still the worst perfoming school out of everyone else. most of the largest
schools had some of the worst perfomance rates compared to the smaller ones

From this chart we can see that charter schools out performed public schools in every category such as reading, math and overall passing rates.



# Summary
From this analysis we concluded that money didnt necessarly gurantee that schools would peform good.
One take away from this is maybe school size has an influence on student perfomance. Less resources per student such as extra curricular activities or 
large class rooms which limit indivdual help for students that need it. It seems to be a common theme as maybe the smaller schools have resources that
are distrubited better because of less students.
